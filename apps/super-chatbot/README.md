## Running locally

Set up your local development environment with the required API keys and configuration:

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that allow others to control access to your AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts: `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your AI media creation platform will be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```

**Create a Video:**

```
"Generate a 10-second video of ocean waves crashing on a beach at golden hour, 30fps, cinematic"
```

**Write a Screenplay:**

```
"Write a 3-page comedy screenplay about two robots learning to dance"
```

**Design a Storyboard:**

```
"Create a 6-panel storyboard for a smartphone commercial with camera angles and transitions"
```

For detailed examples and advanced techniques, see our [Prompt Examples Guide](docs/prompt-examples.md).

## 🐛 Image Generation Debugging

If generated images don't appear in chat, follow these steps:

### 1. Open Browser Console

- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab

### 2. Generate an Image

- Use the chat to request image generation (e.g., "generate image of a cat")

### 3. Monitor Debug Logs

Look for this sequence in console:

```
🎨 ✅ Image completed via SSE file event: [URL]
🔄 ImageArtifactWrapper memo: content changed, triggering re-render
🔧 ImageArtifactWrapper: initial state updated
🎯 ImageEditor: initialState updated
🎯 ImageEditor display state: { showImage: true, displayImageUrl: [URL] }
```

### 4. Quick Fix Commands

If image doesn't appear, try these console commands:

```javascript
quickImageFix(); // Apply last generated image
imageSystem.debug(); // Check system health
checkCurrentArtifact(); // Check artifact state
```

### 5. Save Images Permanently

To keep generated images accessible after closing artifacts:

```javascript
addImageToChat(); // Add last generated image to chat history
addImageToChat("https://your-image-url.com"); // Add specific image URL
```

**Why this is needed:** After closing an artifact, images disappear from the interface. The `addImageToChat()` function adds images to the chat message history where they remain permanently accessible.

### 6. Report Issues

When reporting problems, include:

- Which debug log step is missing/failing
- Full console output with timestamps
- Browser and version information
