Rewrite in the style we use in @CLAUDE.md:
$ARGUMENTS

1. Read all the files.
2. Ultrathink: what is general enough that it's worth remembering? What should be deleted?
3. Write/update the resulting file.

IMPORTANT: Follow the format of CLAUDE.md:

- markdown header + single-level list of facts under it
- focus on providing pointers to base future research on, no need for elaborate examples
- brevity, no full sentences ("military telegram style")
- try to keep examples inline and reduced to the minimal required length

Delete:

- reports on current tasks
- ideas for future work
- self-congratulations
- descriptions of AI's hard and windy path towards completing the tasks

Keep:

- brief facts about quickly overcoming the stumbling blocks encountered
- brief summary of the info that's hard to find
- facts on how parts of the system interact
- brief facts that are haard to quickly grasp from code
- common pitfalls (make sure each one states what to do about it)
