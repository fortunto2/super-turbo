Consolidate and merge all docs you have created (see git diff) into $ARGUMENTS

**Task:** Review recent changes and merge valuable knowledge into permanent documentation.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's general enough that it's worth remembering?
- What is simply a task-specific report that can be discarded?
- What patterns/gotchas will help future development?

**Style:** Follow CLAUDE.md format
- Outline + brevity
- Code pointers, not elaborate examples
- One-line facts that save time

Write the consolidated docs:
- Agent knowledge (patterns, gotchas) → `_ai/` directory
- Public documentation (architecture, API) → `apps/super-chatbot/docs/` directory
